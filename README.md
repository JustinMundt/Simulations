# Simulations

The blackjack simulation is meant as an exercise to determine the viability of betting practices in blackjack. Even with an advantage over the casino with card counting it is still hard to know what betting practices will leave you broke. The monte carlo simulation allows for multiple re-runs of bets simulating potential outcomes. The advantage or disadvante of betting techniqes can be changed by editing the win/loss ratios. The total wallet size and the minimum bets can also be changed as well as the maximum bets per hand.
